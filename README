List Manager is intended to be used to manage lists of files for source
code projects. It was inspired by Makefiles and source code management
software. It's eventual purpose is to keep track of a list of files for
you and give you information about them. For example, if you wanted to
keep track of source files for a code project, you would build a list of
relevant source files by adding them to the List Manager. You could then
retrieve the list whenver you wanted, as well as view the 'status' of
your tree, showing which files are currently listed and which are not.
You could then use the list in build scripts, for example.

List Manager is a work in progress and it may just be reinventing the
square wheel. Time will tell.
